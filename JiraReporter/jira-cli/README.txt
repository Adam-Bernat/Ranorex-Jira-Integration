Download the Jira CLI environment from the following page and unzip it.

The JiraReporter only needs the CLI environment if "OnDemandCreateNewIssueIfTestCaseFails" is used.
You can place the CLI environment at any location on your system. Ranorex just needs the path to the "cli-<version>.jar" file.
